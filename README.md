# Personal Website

This repo is for my personal website hosted at [https://zeleena.com](https://zeleena.com).

## About

### System

The website is running [nginx](https://www.nginx.com/).

It is using [certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) to automate HTTPS management.

### Frontend

Although I consider myself a software _infrastructure_ engineer, I developed the frontend myself (what I mean is, without using a template). But I didn't do it alone! In addition to searching for all kinds of HTML/CSS and JavaScript questions, I also used these sources for a little more style:
* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
  * for content font
* [LogoHub.io](https://logohub.io/)
  * for the favicon
* [Emoji reference](https://www.w3schools.com/charsets/ref_emoji.asp)
